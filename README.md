# LLM Project

## Project Task

In this Language Model (LLM) project, I employed machine learning techniques to analyze and predict customer satisfaction ratings from review texts. The project is essentially a text classification challenge where the objective is to predict categorical ratings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on customer feedback data. The goal of this is to improve business process, be able to accurtaely dertmine customer satisfcation, understand the gaps and customer training needed to be deployed to staff members 


## Dataset
The dataset chosen is from a 'singapore_airlines_reviews sourced from Kaggle. This dataset contains customer reviews and ratings for Singapore Airlines. The dataset is preprocessed; including filtering non-English text, tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization. 


## Pre-trained Model
The project was done using logistic regression model, commonly used for classification tasks. This model was chosen for its efficiency and interpretability in text classification tasks.


## Performance Metrics
To evaluated the effectiveness of this model. 


## Hyperparameters
Hyperparameter tuning was done to enhance the model's predictive power. I employed GridSearchCV to methodically iterate over a range of hyperparameters and identify the optimal combination. The primary hyperparameters fine-tuned included the regularization strength 'C' and 'max_iter', which influences the convergence of the logistic regression algorithm.
